## Before You Read On
This note is my take on explaining the concepts from our textbook. My words should not be taken for granted, and you should do your own research and experiment with your code. Also, I am going to assume that you have already read the chapters regarding this topic.

## CLASS
<p>A Class in Java is a user-defined blueprint from which objects are created.</p>
<p> It specifies:
  <ul>
    <li> Characteristic (Variables) </li>
    <li> Behavior (Methods) </li>
  </ul>
</p>
