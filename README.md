This repository contains Java (JDK 8) codes that demonstrate the usage of the concepts/techniques in Java programming.

## Concepts/Techniques
  - [Threshold-Based Double Comparison](https://github.com/JP1128/CS-Concept-Demonstration/blob/master/Demonstrations/DoubleComparison.java)
  - [Unit Testing](https://github.com/JP1128/CS-Concept-Demonstration/blob/master/Demonstrations/UnitTesting.java)
  - [String's compareTo(String) Method](https://github.com/JP1128/CS-Concept-Demonstration/blob/master/Demonstrations/CompareTo.java)
  - [Object Instantiation and Variable Declaration & Obtaining an Object From Another Object](https://github.com/JP1128/CS-Concept-Demonstration/blob/master/Demonstrations/InstantiationDemo.java)

## How To Use
1. Click on the concept/technique you want to review
2. Click the ***Raw*** button next to ***Blame***
3. Right click anywhere in the newly opened tab
4. Click ***Save as*** and save the file as a ***.java*** file
5. Open the file on Eclipse
6. Read through the comments and run the program
7. Experiment with the program!

## Request
If you are confused about a concept/technique that is not listed, you are welcome to contact me. If I have time, I will try my best to create a code for a guide. 

**I cannot however answer any questions about the graded assignments in CSCI1301 class.** I will only make sample codes that demonstrate the usage of certain concept/technique.
